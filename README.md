# FanControl.ArduinoFanController
Arduino Fan Controller for FanControl is a plugin that allows FanControl to manage fans connected to an Arduino via PWM. It supports 1â€“8 fans (it should be possible for more than 8 but i didn't test) and automatically adapts to the number of fans defined in the Arduino sketch, and sets fans to 30% default speed when no control input is received.

# USE THIS SOFTWARE AT YOUR OWN RISK!
The FanControl.ArduinoFanController doesn't have any negative side effects. However, it is a highly experimental software, and it hasn't been tested fully. Tested versions: "V244".
